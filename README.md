# NextAuth + ApolloGrapqhl Sample

## Overview
In this example, we rely on the following libraries:

* [Next.js](http://nextjs.org/) - the React framework for production. 
* [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) - a complete open source authentication solution for [Next.js](http://nextjs.org/) applications. It is designed from the ground up to support Next.js and Serverless.
* [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/client/) is a GraphQL client that allows you to easily query the exact data you need from a GraphQL server.
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) provides a simple and powerful developer experience, workflows and collaboration for creating applications.

In this simple example, we have the following folders -
1. myauth-client (frontend): we integrate Apollo seamlessly with [Next.js data fetching methods](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching) to fetch queries in the server and hydrate them in the browser. We leverage NextAuth for the authentication process. 
2. myauth-server (backend): we use ApolloGraphql server along with Postgres DB running in a [Docker](https://docker.com) container
